# Exercise: Working with conditionals and loops

## Task 1:

In this exercise, you will create the code for a `for loop`, using the counter variable named `i` starting from `1`.
To make the counter increment by 1 on each loop, you will use `i++`.
The exit condition for the for loop is `i<=10`.

Inside the loop, write an if-else statement, which will check the following conditions:

1. First, it will check if the value of `i` is `1`. If it is, your code will console log the string `"Gold medal"`.

2. Next, I will check if the value of `i` is `2`. If it is, your code will console log the string `"Silver medal"`.

3. Then, your code will check if the value of `i` is `3`. If it is, it will console log the string `"Bronze medal"`.

4. For all the remaining values of `i`, your code will console log just the value of `i`.

## Task 2:

Use the completed code from the previous task, but convert the conditionals to a switch statement.
When you code the solution, the output in the console should remain exactly the same as in the previous question.
You'll need three separate cases for the three medals, and a default case for all other values of the `i` variable.
