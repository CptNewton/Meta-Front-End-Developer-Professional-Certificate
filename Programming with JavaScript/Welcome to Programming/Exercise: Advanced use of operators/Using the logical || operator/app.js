// Imagine you are coding a video game. Currently, you’re about to code some snippets related to the game over condition. You need to code a new variable named timeRemaining and set it to 0. You also need to code a new variable named energy and set it to 10. Next, you should write a piece of code that could be used to determine if the game is over, based on whether either the value of the timeRemaining variable is 0 or the value of the energy variable is 0. Complete the task using the following steps: Declare the variable timeRemaining, and assign the value of 0 to it. Declare the variable energy, and assign the value of 10 to it. Console log the following parameters: "Game over: ", and timeRemaining == 0 || energy == 0

var timeRemaining = 0;
var energy = 10;
console.log("Game over:", timeRemaining == 0 || energy == 0);
