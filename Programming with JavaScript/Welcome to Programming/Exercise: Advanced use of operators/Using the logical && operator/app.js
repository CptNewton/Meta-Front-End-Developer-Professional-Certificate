// You are coding an RPG game, where each character has certain skill levels based on the value saved in their score. Create a variable named  score and set it to 8. Use console.log() that includes the string "Mid-level skills:" and compares the score variable to above 0 and below 10 using the && operator. The expected output in the console should be: "Mid-level skills: true".

var score = 8;
console.log("Mid-level skills:", score > 0 && score < 10);
