### 1. When creating a Provider component, what should you do with the `children` prop that it receives?

- [ ] Nothing, the `children` prop is not necessary and can be skipped during the rendering.
- [ ] You should clone the `children` inside the component to add the context value to it.
- [x] You should wrap the JSX that it returns with a Context Provider component and then pass the `children` through. <br>
      That's correct, the children should be passed as a direct child of the Context Provider element.

### 2. Assuming that the default theme for the application is ‘light’, what should be the default value passed to the `createContext` call?

- [x] undefined. <br>
      That's correct, the default value is not relevant and can be any value. It’s only useful for testing components in isolation or as a default value when a context consumer does not have a Provider further up in the tree.
- [x] null. <br>
      That's correct, the default value is not relevant and can be any value. It’s only useful for testing components in isolation or as a default value when a context consumer does not have a Provider further up in the tree.
- [x] The string "light". <br>
      That's correct, the default value is not relevant and can be any value. It’s only useful for testing components in isolation or as a default value when a context consumer does not have a Provider further up in the tree.

### 3. One of the parts of the context injected into the application is a function called `toggleTheme`. Assuming that the theme is held in some local state as a string that can be either ‘light’ or ‘dark’. What should be the exact implementation of the `toggleTheme` function?

- [x] `toggleTheme: () => setTheme(theme === "light" ? "dark" : "light")`. <br>
      That's correct, that’s the right implementation.
- [ ] `toggleTheme: (theme) => setTheme(!theme)`.
- [ ] `toggleTheme: () => setTheme(theme === "light" ? "light" : "dark")`.
