### In React, functional components are reusable blocks of code that act like a JavaScript function and you can pass data from one component to another using `props`. Which of the following statements are true? Select all that apply.

- [x] `props` are passed using JSX syntax. <br>
      That's correct. It's helpful to think of `props` as arguments that components can accept and are passed using JSX.
- [x] `props` are like a JavaScript object. <br>
      That's correct. `props` are like a JavaScript object in that they can accept many data types including `strings`, `integers`, `functions`, `arrays` and `objects`.
- [x] When two components communicate with each other, the component sending the `props` data is known as the parent and the one receiving the data is known as the child. <br>
      That's correct. Data flow is one-directional which means that a parent component can send the same data to one or more child components, but it's not possible to communicate from the child components back to the parent component using `props`.
